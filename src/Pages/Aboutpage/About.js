              The enduring stories of global events are often found in the
              objects left behind. Artifacts and keepsakes help us connect to
              our own histories and those of others.

              "Grounded: The Pandemic Archive" is our effort to assemble the
              objects that tell our stories. When the virus arrived, flights
              were grounded, young people were grounded with their parents, and
              many of the elderly were grounded by fear. At the same time, we
              have found ways to ground ourselves through self-care, by
              embracing or enhancing the physical space around us, or by
              becoming more "grounded" in our mindset and outlook.

              Through this collective project, we invite you to find and
              preserve an object that captures part of this spectrum of
              experience. What does "Grounded" mean to you?

              We are a group of undergrads and medical school students from
              Washington University in St. Louis. In the future, we hope to use
              this archive to ask research questions about the pandemic
              experience and design an art installation that offers a new
              perspective on this unsettled time. If you are interested in
              learning more about the project, or have questions about how it
              works or why we’re engaging in this work, please reach out to us.
              We will keep you updated via email on when your submissions will
              be displayed!
