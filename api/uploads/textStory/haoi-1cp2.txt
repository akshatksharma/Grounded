This pandemic has been terrible in so many ways, but it has also offered the opportunity for self-reflection and self-growth. I bought this water bottle at the beginning of quarantine, and it represents the new mindset and  new goals that I had developed and have worked on since. First of all, it helped me improve my health— I decided to work out more often, drink more water, and eat healthier. I worked hard and my water bottle carried me through it, offering an ice cold reward whenever I succeeded. Second, I learned how to cook! Eating healthier meant learning what I should and shouldn’t put into my body, and how to find ways to control it. I still go for the occasional McDonalds or Taco Bell run, but also have created some of the most delicious meals I have ever had. Now, living apart from my parents,  I am so thankful that I took the time to learn. My water bottle has stayed with me throughout quarantine and will hopefully last me through the crazy, messed up year that is 2020 (it is also the longest I have had one without losing it, so that’s a good sign!).
