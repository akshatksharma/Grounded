# Grounded: The Pandemic Archive

Grounded: The Pandemic Archive is a project that serves to take a snapshot of the COVID-19 pandemic. Users are encouraged share how they have found new meaning in the physical spaces and objects around them while in quanatine. This pandemic has further exposed the social and racial inequalities that comprise society today. Everyone deserves to have their story told. 

The site is currently down in preparation for a bigger scale launch in 2021. We hope to branch out and document the stories of more and more people from all walks of life.
