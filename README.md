# Grounded: The Pandemic Archive

Grounded: The Pandemic Archive is a project that serves to take a snapshot of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has further exposed the social and racial inequalities that comprise society today. Everyone deserves to have their story told. This site serves as a platform to allow people to share their experiences, and document them in time.

The site is currently down in preparation for a bigger scale launch in 2021. We hope to branch out and document the stories of more and more people from all walks of life.
